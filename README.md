# Express Generator TypeScript

A node.js boiler plate that uses [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) as a base code and ported to TypeScript.

The main difference of this package to the others is that this uses a fresh install for express-generator without dependencies

## Installation
clone this repo and use as you please

```bash
  cd express-generator-ts-boilerplate
  rm -rf .git
```
change to your project name
```
  cd ../
  mv express-generator-ts-boilerplate [your project name]
```


## Optimizations

Future optimizations will include cli to not have to rely on deleting the .git directory
