# Express Generator TypeScript

A node.js boiler plate that uses [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) as a base code and ported to TypeScript.

The main difference of this package to the others is that this uses a fresh install for express-generator without dependencies

## Installation
clone this repo
